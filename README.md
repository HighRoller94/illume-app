# Illume

Social Media CRUD application aimed at helping creatives and young professionals network, grow their business and sell their work.

Built with React, Illume includes it's own timeline and profile features, just like any other social network. It expands on this further by including it's own professional user based gallery page, allowing users to upload and showcase their work. It also includes a user based marketplace and store system, as well as ecommerce cart functionality, allowing users to open their own store. 

Users can further search for work within the jobs section, where they can either list their own work listings or reply/apply to others, the ultimate goal being a one-stop shop for everything that a young creative may need.
